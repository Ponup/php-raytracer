 	 * The basic idea behind this test is that we construct a right-triangle using the prime ray as the adjacent side and the line between the origin and the center of the sphere as the hypotenuse. Then we calculate the length of the opposite side using the Pythagorean Theorem - if that side is smaller than the radius of the sphere, the ray must intersect the sphere. In practice, we actually do the check on length-squared values because square roots are expensive to calculate, but itâ€™s the same idea.
